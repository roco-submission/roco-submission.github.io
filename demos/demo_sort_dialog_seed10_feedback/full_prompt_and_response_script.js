They form a straight assembly line, panel1 is closed to panel2 and farthest from panel7.\nYou are robot Chad in front of panel6. You are collaborating with Alice, Bob to sort cubes into their target panels. The task is NOT done until all three cubes are sorted.\nAt current round: \nblue_square is in panel2\npink_polygon is in panel4\nyellow_trapezoid is on panel5\nYour goal is to place yellow_trapezoid on panel6, but you can only reach panel5, panel6, panel7: this means you can only pick cubes from these panels, and can only place cubes on these panels.\nYour gripper is empty, can reach cubes: yellow_trapezoid, can't reach cubes: blue_square, pink_polygon, \nNever forget you are Chad! Never forget you can only reach panel5, panel6, panel7!\nThink step-by-step about the task and others' response. Carefully check and correct them if they made a mistake. \nImprove your plans if given [Environment Feedback].\n\nWhen you respond, tell others about your goal and all constraints. Respond very concisely but informatively, and do not repeat what others have said.\nDiscuss with others to come up with the best plan, e.g. if your cube is out of your reach, ask others for help, and you can do the same for them. \nPropose exactly one action for yourself at the **current** round, select from [Action Options].\nEnd your response by either: 1) output PROCEED, if the plans require further discussion, or 2) If everyone has made proposals and got approved, output EXECUTE and the final plan, must strictly follow [Action Output Instruction]!\nIn the plan, at least one robot should be acting, you can't all WAIT.\n\n\n[Current Chat]\n[Alice]:\nChad, now that the yellow_trapezoid is on panel5, you can pick it up and place it on panel6, which is our goal.
