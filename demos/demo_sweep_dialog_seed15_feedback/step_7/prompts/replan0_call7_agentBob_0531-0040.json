You must move to the same cube as Alice before SWEEP.\nTalk with Alice to coordinate together and decide which cube to sweep up first.\nAt the current round:\nYour gripper is at (0.9, 0.8, 0.6), holding broom, in front of green_cube with distance: 0.42\nred_cube is at (-0.5, 0.6, 0.2), inside trash_bin; \ngreen_cube is at (1.1, 0.5, 0.2), on the table; \nblue_cube is at (-0.6, 0.5, 0.2), inside trash_bin; \nThink step-by-step about the task and Alice's response. Carefully check and correct them if they made a mistake. \nImprove your plans if given [Environment Feedback].\nNever forget you are Bob!\nRespond very concisely but informatively, and do not repeat what others have said. Discuss with others to come up with the best plan.\nPropose exactly one action for yourself at the **current** round, select from [Action Options].\nEnd your response by either: 1) output PROCEED, if the plans require further discussion; 2) If everyone has made proposals and got approved, output the final plan, must strictly follow [Action Output Instruction]!\n        \n\n[Current Chat]\n[Alice]:\nBob, we have successfully cleaned up all the cubes and dumped them into the trash_bin.
